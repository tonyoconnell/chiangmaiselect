One-click is literal if you are setting up BulletProof Security using the Setup Wizard. BPS is setup completely and all security features are turned on when you click the Setup Wizard button. One-click is used figuratively and not literally if you are using the Manual Controls to setup BulletProof Security. One-click is generally the concept where several tasks are performed with one-click of a button. BPS BulletProof Modes Manual setup actually takes 4 clicks, but with those 4 clicks BPS BulletProof Modes are setup and the website has maximum security enabled with all BPS security features and code enabled instead of having to choose multiple separate options and settings.

msgid "WordPress Website Security Protection: BulletProof Security protects your website against 100,000's of different hacking attempts/attacks. The .htaccess security filters in BulletProof Security are designed to match malicious and nuisance attack patterns. The most important benefits of using a finite pattern matching method vs infinite banning/blocking individual IP's, Host's, Referer's, etc. is that your website performance and Server resources are not negatively impacted. In general, BulletProof Security takes an \"Action Approach\" to website security. Hacker X, Spammer X, Bad Bot X does bad Action Y = Forbidden/Blocked. An \"Action Approach\" is a much more effective and performance optimized approach to website security since the bad action itself is being blocked/forbidden instead of attempting to block an individual hacker/spammer that performed a bad action. Example: BulletProof Security blocks all SQL Injection hacking attempts/attacks no matter who performed that SQL Injection hacking attempt/attack.

FrontEnd Maintenance mode is primarily designed for development/maintenance purposes and BackEnd Maintenance Mode is technically a security feature since enabling BackEnd Maintenance Mode allows you to deny access to the /wp-admin folder/WP Dashboard by IP address.

BulletProof Security uses .htaccess website security files, which are specific to Apache Linux Servers. Please read the FAQ page for Server compatibility questions."

The Setup Wizard performs Pre-Installation Checks to check for any pre-existing issues that could cause any issues or problems and displays exactly what needs to be done to fix the issue. The primary troubleshooting feature in BulletProof Security is the BPS Security Log. The primary whitelisting feature in BulletProof Security is BPS Custom Code. The BPS Security Log logs blocked hackers, spammers, bad bots, etc. and also logs anything else that is blocked by BPS. If something legitimate is being blocked in another plugin or theme that needs to be allowed/whitelisted then the BPS Security Log entry will contain all the information about what exactly is being blocked so that a whitelist rule can then be created in BPS Custom Code. The BPS Security Log also logs all other 403 errors that occur on your website whether or not they are related to or caused by BPS. Turning Off BPS Security Logging will allow your server to handle error logging and display your server error message instead of BPS displaying the standard 403 template file error message. This is also considered a troubleshooting method to determine if an error is actually coming from your server and not the BPS plugin."

BulletProof Security also offers full manual control of editing .htaccess files using the built-in .htaccess File Editor. The BPS Master .htaccess files are pre-made. When you run the Setup Wizard or click the AutoMagic buttons your .htaccess Master files are created with specific code for your specific website. You can add additional code to BPS Custom Code or edit the .htaccess files directly or create completely new .htaccess master files from within the WordPress Dashboard using the built-in BPS File Editor or Custom Code - no FTP required - no Web Host Control Panel required. Automation is great, but also having full manual editing control makes BulletProof Security very versatile."
